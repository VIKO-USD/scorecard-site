This includes new data as well as updates to data we have already published. We will continue to collect data from existing sources where possible.\n\nHow do I suggest new or different data sources?\nIf you have feedback on the data sources we have used or have suggestions for new data sources then please email us at {{site.email_contacts.questions}}.\n\nWhat are you doing to fill data gaps?\nFor some indicators, although we may have data at the national level, our existing data sources don’t always allow us to disaggregate by all main groups.\n\nThis means we need to look for new data sources, link existing ones, or model data.\n\nWhat does the reporting status mean?\nWe have used three different types of reporting status for an indicator, which are also colour coded:\n\n\n  \n    Reported (black): As a minimum the headline national data for this indicator is available on this website but the data might not be fully disaggregated yet. We are continuing to source additional disaggregations.\n  \n  \n    Statistics in progress (grey): We have found a suitable source of data for this indicator or relevant proxy at national level. We are currently quality assuring the data and preparing it for publication.\n  \n  \n    No data available (white): We are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator.\n  \n  \n    Not applicable (striped): This indicator is not applicable in the national context.\n  \n\n\nCan other countries copy this website?\nYes. See the Open SDG Quick Start guide for technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running.\n\nHow accessible is this website?\nOpen SDG aims to be as accessible and usable as possible for every user and works towards meeting AA level of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0).\n\nWhat browsers can I use to view this website?\nOur website works with most of the latest versions of the commonly used browsers.\n\nWhat do each of the three tiers mean?\nEach of the SDG indicators are assigned to one (or more) of the following tiers:\n\n  \n    Tier 1: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.\n  \n  \n    Tier 2: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries.\n  \n  \n    Tier 3: No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested (As of the 51st session of the UN Statistical Commission, the global indicator framework does not contain any Tier III indicators)\n  \n\n\nAs of 28 December 2020: The updated tier classification contains 130 Tier I indicators, 97 Tier II indicators and 4 indicators that have multiple tiers (different components of the indicator are classified into different tiers).\n\nFor more information, see the IAEG-SDGs Tier Classification for Global SDG Indicators\n\nBack to
